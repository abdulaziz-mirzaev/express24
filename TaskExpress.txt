Add Two Numbers


Given two linked lists representing two numbers (integers). The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of the nodes contains a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

 
Constraints:
Use PHP/Python/Go
Upper Middle / Senior
Linked List functionality should be implemented by you (by creating one or more classes)
Middle
Use any implementation available for the programming language you have picked
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros
